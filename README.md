# Informatica Bac App

Application built in Android Studio with Java, HTML/CSS and XAML programming languages.<br><br>
It is built around the Romanian baccalaureate exam. It teaches you the basics of the C++ programming language.<br><br>
In addition to the structured theory chapters (photo 3), the application also contains a quiz in which students can practice for the final exam. The subjects from past years could not be missing (photo 6), which can be viewed directly in the application with the help of an implemented PDF viewer.<br><br>
These days, you have to implement more themes in your application, so 2 themes are available, light and dark. (photo 4/5)<br><br>
You can leave the app anytime! It's just like a book, you can read the chapters anywhere and if you have to leave the app in the middle of a chapter, don't worry! When you come back, the "Continue learning" button (photo 1/2) will take you to the last page you were reading.<br><br>
You already know the basics of C++, but you forgot something? Go to the 'Chapters List' menu (3rd photo) and choose the subject you want to read again.
