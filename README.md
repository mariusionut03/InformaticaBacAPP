# Informatica Bac App

Application built in Android Studio with Java, HTML/CSS and XAML programming languages.<br><br>
It is built around the Romanian baccalaureate exam. It teaches you the basics of the C++ programming language.<br><br>
In addition to the structured theory chapters, the application also contains a quiz in which students can practice for<br><br>
the final exam. The subjects from past years could not be missing, which can be viewed directly in the application with the help of an implemented PDF viewer.<br><br>
These days, you have to implement more themes in your application, so 2 themes are available, light and dark.<br>
